# Citadel-SoCal-Datathon-2018-1st-Place-Winners
We received first place honors in the annual Citadel SoCal Data Open held at California Institute of Technology.  We were awarded $20,000 and entry into the championship round to be held at the New York Stock Exchange in 2019.  The Datathon had over 400 applicants of which 100 were selected to compete.

This year's data delt with water usage, pollutants, and droughts through every county in the United States.  We analyzed the effects of several factors on water scarcity and sanitation using publicly available data.  We also built a supervised learning model to predict drought severity in the future.
