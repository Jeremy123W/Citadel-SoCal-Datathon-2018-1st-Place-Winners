# Citadel-SoCal-Datathon-2018-1st-Place-Winners
1st Place submission in the annual Citadel SoCal Data Open held at California Institute of Technology.

This year's data delt with water usage, pollutants, and droughts through every county in the United States.  We analyzed the effects of several factors on water scarcity and sanitation using publicly available data.  We also built a supervised learning model to predict drought severity in the future.
